# willie-modules

*- a repository of modules for [willie](http://willie.dftba.net/)* 

###installation
the repository follows willie's local configuration folder's ~/.willie/ structure,
where modules from this repository (located in modules/), would be placed in ~/.willie/modules/.
in addition, we also have a conf-module/ folder containing configurations for some modules.

one could also use git to clone this repo into one's own ~/.willie/ folder:

- `cd ~/.willie/`
- `git clone https://github.com/teamsrg/willie-modules.git .`
- shitpost

a future solution will allow administrators of willie to use the webload module to download and install modules
directly from this repo.
