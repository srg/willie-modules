# willie-modules
##*- a repository of modules for [willie](http://willie.dftba.net/)* 

###installation
the repository follows willie's local configuration folder's (`~/.willie/`) structure,
where modules from this repository (located in `modules/`, would be placed in `~/.willie/modules/`.
in addition, there is also a `conf-module/` folder containing configurations for some modules.

one could also use git to clone this repo into one's own `~/.willie/` folder:
1. `cd ~/.willie/`
2. `git clone https://github.com/teamsrg/willie-modules.git`
3. shitpost

a future solution will allow administrators of willie to use webload to download and install modules
directly from this repo.
